## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note (different depending on the OS)

* This is a resubmission.

* 1 note on windows: Possible mispelling unknown word ERGMs: It is the right
  spelling. In the literature, ERGM is used for single models while ERGMs for
  multiple.

* 1 note on Ubuntu: The note is regarding the size of the package. Since I'm
  using RcppArmadillo I don't have much control on the size of it. Yet, I'm
  constantly working on reducing it's size.
  
## Responses to CRAN comments:

* Regarding usage of "dontrun": I've corrected as suggested, now the only dontrun
  we have is in a test that is expected to produce an error.
  
* On the year of the LICENCE file, I've update it to 2020.
