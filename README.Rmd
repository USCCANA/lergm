# lergm: Estimation of Little 'ERGMs' using exact likelihood

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("USCCANA/lergm")
```
## Example

An example from the manual

## When `ergm` is not enough

```{r net1}
library(lergm)
library(sna)

# Generating a small graph
set.seed(12)
n <- 4
net <- sna::rgraph(n, tprob = .7)
gplot(net)
```

```{r comparing-w-ergm}
model <- net ~ edges + mutual + balance

library(ergm)
ans_lergm <- lergm(model)
ans_ergm  <- ergm(model)

# The lergm should have a larger value
ergm.exact(ans_lergm$coef, model)
ergm.exact(ans_ergm$coef, model)

summary(ans_lergm)
summary(ans_ergm)
```

Checking convergence diagnostics

```{r convergence-diag}
plot(ans_lergm)
```


## Do we get the same?

```{r net2}
# Generating a small graph
set.seed(12123)
n   <- 4
net <- sna::rgraph(n, tprob = .3)
gplot(net)
```

```{r}
model <- net ~ edges + mutual

library(ergm)
ans_lergm <- lergm(model)
ans_ergm  <- ergm(model, control = control.ergm(
  MCMC.effectiveSize = 4000,
  seed = 444)
  )

# The lergm should have a larger value
ergm.exact(ans_lergm$coef, model) > ergm.exact(ans_ergm$coef, model)

summary(ans_lergm)
summary(ans_ergm)
```
