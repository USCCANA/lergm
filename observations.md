# Omission and commission errors in network cognition and network estimation using ROC curve

*   The package [cssTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cssTools/cssTools.pdf)
    implements methods for estimating true networks.

*   In *Omission and commission errors in network cognition and network estimation
    using ROC curve* they point out that a good measure of accuracy can be using
    the $S_{14}$ statistic pointed out by Krackhardt (1990) and developed by
    Gower and Legendre (1986).
    
    From Krackhardt (1990)
    
    > Of these measures, one (called S14 in their article) stood out by exhibiting
    high resolution (appropriate sensitivity to small changes in correspondence) and
    low nonlinearity (low distortion at extreme values).
    -- Krackhardt (1990) p. 350
