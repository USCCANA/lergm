Title: Estimation of 'ERGMitos' (a.k.a. Little 'ERGMs') using exact likelihood
Description: The package implements simulation and estimation algorithms for 
  Exponential Random Graph Models in the case of small networks using exact
  statistics. As a difference from the 'ergm' package, 'ergmito' skips the
  MCMC part of the estimation process and goes straight to MLE.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
