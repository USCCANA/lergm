\usage{
new_rergmito(model, theta = NULL, sizes = NULL, mc.cores = 2L,
  force = FALSE, ...)

\method{[}{ergmito_sampler}(x, i, j, ...)

\method{print}{ergmito_sampler}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A formula.}

\item{theta}{Named vector. Model parameters.}

\item{sizes}{Integer vector. Values between 2 to 5 (6 becomes too intensive).}

\item{mc.cores}{Integer. Passed to \link[parallel:mclapply]{parallel::mclapply}}

\item{force}{Logical. When \code{FALSE} (default) will try to use \code{ergmito}'s stat
count functions (see \link{count_stats}). This means that if one of the requested
statistics in not avialable in \code{ergmito}, then we will use \code{ergm} to compute
them, which is significatnly slower (see details).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \link[ergm:ergm.allstats]{ergm::ergm.allstats}.}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{ergmito_sampler}.}

\item{i, j}{\code{i} is an integer vector indicating the indexes of the networks to
draw, while \code{j} the corresponding sizes. These need not to be of the same size.}
}
\value{
An environment with the following objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{calc_prob}
\item \code{call}
\item \code{counts}
\item \code{networks}
\item \code{prob}
\item \code{sample} A function to draw samples. \code{n} specifies the number of samples to
draw, \code{s} the size of the networks, and \code{theta} the parameter to use to
calculate the likelihoods.
\item \code{theta}
}

The indexing method \code{[.ergmito_sampler} returns a named list of length
\code{length(j)}.

\description{
Using
}
\details{
While the \CRANpkg{ergm} package is very efficient, it was not built to do some
of the computations requiered in the ergmito package. This translates in having
some of the functions of the package (ergm) with poor speed performance. This
led us to "reinvent the wheel" in some cases to speed things up, this includes
calculating observed statistics in a list of networks.

The indexing method, \code{[.ergmito_sampler}, allows extracting networks
directly by passing indexes. \code{i} indicates the index of the networks to draw,
which go from 1 through \code{2^(n*(n-1))}, and \code{j} indicates the requested
size.
